# karatsuba
Final Project for CS2800: Logic & Computation

This project implements the Karatsuba multipication algorithm, including its necessary helper
functions and a unique data definition for representing natural numbers as backward lists of
digits. You can view and interact with the project by uploading the karatsuba.lisp file to
Eclipse and running it (creating a new .acl2 file). Here, you can call the functions we have
implemented and multipication on back-nats using the Karatsuba algorithm.
