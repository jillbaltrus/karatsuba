# karatsuba
Final Project for CS2800: Logic & Computation

This project implements the Karatsuba multipication algorithm, including its necessary helper
functions and a unique data definition for representing natural numbers as backward lists of
digits. 

To view and run the code, upload the file into Eclipse and start a new ACL2 session form the file.
From here, you can call all the functions we have implemented and perform multipication on back-nats
using the Karatsuba function.
